        <h3><li>WATER MY PLANTS</li></h3>
        <img src="/images/flower.jpg" width="300px" alt="">
        <p>Think of plant cells as water balloons. When they are filled with water, they become stiff, and your plant stands upright. When there is a lack of water, the cells deflate, and the plant looks wilted—a clear sign your plant needs more water if paired with dry potting mix. Plants also produce cellulose that help them keep their shape, but water pressure (water flowing through the plant) helps plants gain and retain their shape better than cellulose alone.</p>

        <h3><li>VISIT GRANNY</li></h3>
        <p>My grandmother stays in a small town near Berlin.

            Her house is very beautiful and it is located in the middle of the town. The house has four bedrooms and a huge kitchen. This time when we went to meet her, I found her lovely garden full of beautiful flowers.</p>

        <h3><li>PLAY MAUNE</li></h3>
        <img src="images/kaari.jpg" width="300px" alt="">
        <p>This was the first permanent structure <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nairobi " target="_blank"> in the town</a>, with its walls built with stones pasted together by mud, while the floor was wooden. Today, this building stands as an icon of Meru’s colonial history.

            On May 13, 1911, Horne declared all the area within a radius of one mile from his headquarters a township under the East African Township Ordinance Act of 1903. That is how Meru town was born.
